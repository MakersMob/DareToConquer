				<p>If you&rsquo;re on this page then you probably know who I am. If you don&rsquo;t then pretend I am a really cool person.</p>
				<p>The fact of the matter is it is 11:42pm and I am tired as hell. I should probably have a cooler page set up to really impress you and blow your mind but I just don't have the energy.</p>
				<p>Instead, for now, just know that <em>Dare to Conquer</em> is my place to share EVERYTHING that I know about growing multiple 5 & 6-figure online businesses.</p>
				<p>You can gain access to everything that is available now and in the future by checking out the <a href="/join">join join join join join page</a>.</p>
				<p>You can also see what <a href="/course">courses I currently have available to purchase on an individual basis</a> or if you just want the free goods then check out <a href="/bootcamp">the bootcamps</a>.</p>
				<p>I'm off to bed. I have more stuff to create for DTC Members tomorrow.</p>
