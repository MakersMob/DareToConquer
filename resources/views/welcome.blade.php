				<p>On a site like this I'm supposed to sell you some type of dream.</p>
				<p>You see, to succeed in online business you have to make the potential buyer believe that you are going to be the one to help them get from Point A to Point B.</p>
				<p>In essence, you're going to provide them with the bridge that will close THE GAP.</p>
				<p>In the <em>how to make money</em> industry this especially holds true but there is a big problem. Simply learning the techniques is often not enough because you'll find a way to prevent your own success.</p>
				<p><strong>You yourself have to be brave (or stupid) enough to conquer many different things.</strong></p>
				<p>(Now you see where the name comes from.)</p>
				<p>So, am I the one that is going to help you out with all of this? I'll certainly try but you have to be open to the idea of pushing yourself.</p>
				<p>Wait, you're probably trying to figure out who in the hell I am. Sorry about that.</p>
				<p>My name is Paul Scrivens and I'm fortunate enough to run three 6-figure (this means they make 6-figures a year) business and three 5-figure businesses.</p>
				<p>It allows me to pretty much live the life that I want.</p>
				<p>That means hanging out with family and friends whenever I want. Not worrying about how much we can spend at the grocery store.</p>
				<p><strong>Most importantly I get to focus on being the best version of me.</strong></p>
				<p>It is awesome and I know others want to have the same type of experience so here I am teaching what I know.</p>
