				<p>My favorite books as a kid were the <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> books. My Mom didn't like me reading them because they weren't really books. More like videogames in text form.</p>
				<div class="image" style="float:left; margin-right: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">

				<p>Anyways, I loved them because I liked the idea of there being more than one path to take. Nothing was ever definitive. Sometimes you would get a good ending and other times you didn't.</p>
				<p>Whenever you got a bad ending it wasn't so bad because you could always go back a couple of steps and try again.</p>
				<p>This is exactly like building an online business. Sometimes you turn the page and think <em>damn, I didn't want this ending</em> while other times you turn the page and successfully reach the goal.</p>
				<p><strong><em>Dare to Conquer</em> isn't about finding the one true path to success.</strong> It's about conquering a lot of different things that over time will lead you to your goals.</p>
				<p>So in true <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> style, you get to pick your next step (please note I say "online business" and you can replace that with <em>blog</em> if you want):</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/origin-story">I don't even know where to begin or know if this online business thing is for me.</a></li>
					<li><a href="/no-traffic">I started my online business but nobody is visiting me.</a></li>
					<li><a href="/want-more-money">I'm making a little bit of money but I'm definitely not hitting my potential.</a></li>
					<li><a href="/online-funnels">I think I've taken things as far as I can, but maybe there is another level to go that I'm missing.</a></li>

				<p>If you're the type that likes to scan a whole page to see what is going on then I've created a section just for you.</p>
				<p>Seriously.</p>
				<p>That's why I just made the paragraph above a single word because it is supposed to get your attention.</p>
				<p>Even better I created a video for you to watch.</p>
				<p>Watch it.</p>
				<h2>Why Does Dare to Conquer Exist?</h2>
				<p>I've been in the position where I wondered if there was more for me out there. Why was I spending so much time making other people money?</p>
				<p>I've been lost staring at the computer screen freaking out because I didn't know where to even begin.</p>
				<p>I've been pulling my hair out because nobody was coming to my site.</p>
				<p>Nothing is more frustrating than knowing there is opportunity at your fingertips but for some reason your hands are covered in butter and you just can't grasp it.</p>
				<p><em>Dare to Conquer</em> exists because you shouldn't have to feel any of this.</p>
				<p><strong>You deserve the opportunity to strive for the lifestyle that you desire.</strong></p>
