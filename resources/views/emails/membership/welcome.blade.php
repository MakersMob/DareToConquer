<p>Yeaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!</p>

<p>This is the moment you need to give yourself some props. You deserve a celebration because you've made an active decision to improve your life.</p>

<p>Some people wake up each day wishing could do that but you decided you WOULD do that.</p>

<p>I'm truly honored that you're trusting me with helping you on this journey and believe me when I say that I'll do everything in my powers to make it a successful one.</p>

<p>You'll start to get some emails from the DTC Community Manager, Marybeth, along with an invite into the Slack Community.</p>

<p>You should've already seen the inside of the site along with the welcome video so not much more to add to this email besides:</p>

<p>WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME!</p>
