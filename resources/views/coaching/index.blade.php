				<p><strong>You can purchase a special coaching package where I will go through the steps to the planner with you and make sure you hit each one.</strong></p>
				<p>I'll be your blog coach or whatever.</p>
				<p>However, I've done this in the past and it's very time-consuming but I like case studies so these will be excellent case studies.</p>
				<p>Not everyone can get in on this. Hm, let's just say 4 people can get a coaching package so the <strong>first 4 people to purchase the coaching package get in</strong>. Everyone else will just have to wait and see if I do these in the future at a much higher price.</p>
				<p><em>Damn, this page is getting kind of long.</em></p>
				<p>What is involved in the coaching package? Hm, let's go with 6 months of coaching. That means you have special email access to me where I will respond within 24 hours (usually way faster). Monthly phone call sessions (if you want). Basically you have me as your guide as we knock out these milestones.</p>
				<p><strong>If we are unable to hit these milestones and it's my fault, not yours, then I'll give you your money back.</strong> (<em>Worst business idea ever.</em>) My fault is that I continued to give you advice that didn't work. Your fault is if you just didn't do any of the work and tell me you "don't have time for this".</p>
				<p><strong>Coaching starts on September 17th.</strong></p>
