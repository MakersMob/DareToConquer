				<p><em>Takes a deep breath...</em></p>
				<p><strong>I'm going to try to sell you something that doesn't exist anywhere else besides my mind.</strong></p>
				<p>By all accounts that should mean you close this tab and disappear. No hard feelings. I understand. You can still come over for BBQ.</p>
				<p>But for those of you sticking around then check this out.</p>
				<p><em>This part sounds like bragging...</em></p>
				<p>I've created 3 6-figure a year businesses along with 5-figure a year businesses this year.</p>
				<p><em>I warned you about the bragging.</em></p>
				<p>This isn't bragging but an important part of the setup.</p>
				<p>I like to think this makes me different from most people doing this stuff.</p>
				<p>Not all of the businesses were built in the same way. The ones that made money with ads took one approach while the ones built around products took a completely different approach.</p>
				<p>Sure, I could've combined both approaches for one super mega Godzilla approach but I like to experiment and here is what I found:</p>
				<p><strong>Each of these businesses had very specific milestones that I could lay out and when I reached them I knew I was ready for the next phase of growth.</strong></p>
				<p>That means I could sit down and make a step-by-step plan of action for a specific type of online business, follow those steps myself or hand them off for someone else to follow and create an awesome business.</p>
				<p>But don't be fooled, this stuff isn't for every single niche in existence. I'm not that good.</p>
				<p>Some niches just can't grow big enough for ads and other niches will have a really hard time coming up with a product idea that is worth the time.</p>
				<p>(If you're wondering how you find these things out the easiest way is to just look around your niche. If others have had success making money a certain way then why can't you?)</p>
				<p><strong>So what I'm going to do is create some planners.</strong> <em>Planners</em> probably isn't even the best term to use for them.</p> 
				<p>Consider them more like awesome field guides that direct you in what you need to do before you move on to the next level.</p>
				<p><strong>Two different planners but they aren't going to be released until October 15th.</strong></p>
				<p>That's a long ways away.</p>
				<p>That's so far away I didn't even have time to create fake images of these planners to make you think you're getting a 12-inch binder full of pages.</p>
				<p><em>I'm selling these 100% on reputation alone so hopefully mine is halfway decent.</em></p>
				<p>I prefer not to create physical planners that I have to keep in my garage and ship out when people want them so these will be fully digital (PDF files). You can print them out and put them in a cool binder if you want.</p>
				<p>Each planner will set the expectations for each phase of your business's growth. It will go over the steps that you'll need to accomplish but it won't be an in-depth guide on how to master everything. For example, if one of the steps is get to 100 pageviews a day, the planner isn't going to show you how to do that in Pinterest.</p>
				<p>I have courses for that kind of stuff.</p>
				<p><strong>If you're a current BBC Member you do not need to buy a planner. They will be included in your account when they launch.</strong> However, if you want one of the other packages BELOW the planners then you'll have to buy the whole thing.</p>
				<p>Everyone else will need to purchase them.</p>
				<p>But just to have a bit of fun I'm going to add in something special. See further below for details.</p>

				<h2>Pre-Purchase the Planners and Save Half Off</h2>
				<p>For the brave people putting their trust in the fact that I know what I'm doing you deserve to be rewarded so I'm opening up a pre-launch sale that saves you 50% if you purchase today.</p>
				<p>Yes, I'm using two different sale tactics in one:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Sale price $99 (50% off)</li>
					<li>Scarcity with the sale price (only 50 people get access to this offer)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If you want to wait (a reasonable choice) until October 15th to see what the big deal is then you'll have to pay full price ($199).</p>
				<p>Seriously, the only thing on this page that might even convince you to buy these planners is you thinking "Scrivs knows his shit and this is going to be awesome".</p>
				<p><strong>Of course, if you are not satisfied with what I produce you can get your money back, no questions asked.</strong></p>

				<h2>Planner + Site Review: $299</h2>
				<p>Want a planner and a site review? Sounds great, right? But what is a site review?</p>
				<p>I'll spend a couple hours pouring over your site and then providing you with an extensive review on what needs to be improved and the steps you need to take to move forward.</p>
				<p>I have to limit this one due to time constraints and yes, you have to buy a planner as well. You can't just get a site review.</p>
				<p><strong>Only 10 of these are available right now.</strong></p>

				<h2>Planner + 6-Month Mentorship: $999</h2>
				<p><strong>You can purchase a special mentorship package where I will go through the steps to the planner with you and make sure you hit each one.</strong></p>
				<p>I'll be your blog mentor or whatever.</p>
				<p>However, I've done this in the past and it's very time-consuming but I like case studies so these will be excellent case studies.</p>
				<p>Not everyone can get in on this. Hm, let's just say 4 people can get a coaching package so the <strong>first 4 people to purchase the coaching package get in</strong>. Everyone else will just have to wait and see if I do these in the future at a much higher price.</p>
				<p><em>Damn, this page is getting kind of long.</em></p>
				<p>What is involved in the coaching package? Hm, let's go with 6 months of coaching. That means you have special email access to me where I will respond within 24 hours (usually way faster). Monthly phone call sessions (if you want). Basically you have me as your guide as we knock out these milestones.</p>
				<p><strong>If we are unable to hit these milestones and it's my fault, not yours, then I'll give you your money back.</strong> (<em>Worst business idea ever.</em>) My fault is that I continued to give you advice that didn't work. Your fault is if you just didn't do any of the work and tell me you "don't have time for this".</p>
				<p><strong>Mentorship starts on September 17th. Only 4 are available.</strong></p>
