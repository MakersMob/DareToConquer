				<p>My family didn't really have money growing up. I mean we always had food on the table and a roof over our heads, but there weren't any luxuries beyond that.</p>

				<p>I didn't really have a firm grasp of what money was all about when I was little. I just knew that whenever I wanted to do something the only deciding factor was whether or not we had money.</p>

				<p>I knew money was the reason my parents went to jobs they hated. My Dad working the night shift while my Mom had to get up at 2:30am to get ready for work.</p>

				<p>I understood money was the reason I had to get a scholarship if I wanted to go to college.</p>

				<p>Money was an issue, but I didn't quite grasp what it was. I was always told that money wasn't everything by television shows.</p>

				<p><strong>I didn't truly understand what money brought until I sold my first site for $20,000.</strong> I spent it all within 90 days but what that amount of money showed me was that money equals freedom.</p>

				<p>Having that money meant freedom from stress.</p>

				<p>Having that money meant freedom from worry.</p>

				<p>Having that money meant more time.</p>

				<p>Having that money meant I could do things that I wasn't able to before.</p>

				<p>Money was my freedom.</p>

				<p>When I spent it all, life returned to how I remembered it. Stress, worry, and all of those other things.</p>

				<p>That's when I realized that there was nothing wrong with wanting to make a lot of money.</p>

				<p>I don't know if it was my imagination but I felt like society put a stigma on wanting more money. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a limit. There is no reason Jeff Bezos should want more money but if you're making $30,000 a year then wanting more money seems natural.</p>

				<p>We live in a world where money provides you with opportunities.</p>

				<p>I didn't necessarily want more money.</p>

				<p><strong>I wanted the things that more money would get me.</strong></p>

				<h2>A Million Dollars</h2>

				<p>I remember I told my wife the day I was going to try and make a million dollars in a year. She did that smile that she does when I say something outrageous and she simply replied:</p>

				<blockquote>
				<p>I would just like to pay rent on time this month.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Ouch.</p>

				<p>Okay then, back to reality.</p>

				<p>The reality was that I needed to get my business to cover our bills and then I could do that whole million dollar thing.</p>

				<p>I remember when <a href="https://thrivestrive.com" target="_blank">Thrive/Strive</a> was making enough money from ads on a consistent basis to pay for rent. It was the most ridiculous relief that I've ever felt. It was like getting a paycheck every month no matter what happened.</p>

				<p>But I needed more than a simple paycheck. <strong>I wanted freedom money.</strong></p>

				<p>I wanted money where if my wife said she wanted to go shopping it wasn't an issue. Where if we went out to eat I didn't need to worry about the cost of an appetizer. Where when my family wanted to visit, I could buy their plane tickets and make it happen.</p>
