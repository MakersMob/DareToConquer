				<p>Creating a product was nothing new to me. However, creating a successful product was something entirely new to me.</p>

				<p>Back in the day I wrote a book because I was reading about how people were making good money with books. I was a paper chaser back then meaning if I saw someone do something and make money, then I would do it as well.</p>

				<p>I wrote the book in 3 weeks. I loved it.</p>

				<p><strong>Nobody bought it.</strong></p>

				<p>It's hard to describe the feeling of working so hard on something and having these wild expectations about it only to find out that the world sees things differently.</p>

				<p>Over the course of 9 years after that experience I created a couple more products but I never released them.</p>

				<p>I sat down, spent an insane amount of time creating them, and then I left them on the computer.</p>

				<p><strong>I didn't want to experience that feeling again so I did nothing.</strong></p>

				<p>But that had to change if I wanted to make more money because ad revenue was reaching a ceiling and providing services was taking too much time.</p>

				<div class="recap">
				<h3>Time for Money Exchange</h3>
				<p>You can make a LOT of money providing services but the problem with services is that you are often trading time for money, just like at a job.</p>
				<p>You just happen to be making more money for the time, usually.</p>
				<p>But it doesn't compete to making money passively with a product.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Instead of blindly creating another product I made sure to ask my audience this time.</p>

				<p>I had built up a small mailing list of about 500 people over at <a href="https://obstacle.co" target="_blank">Obstacle.co</a> so I asked them if they would be interested in seeing my Pinterest strategy.</p>

				<p>I got about a dozen people to reply saying yes. So then I asked them would they be willing to pay me $20 for early access to a product showing my strategy.</p>

				<p>9 out of 10 said yes, so I collected the money and started working on a Pinterest book.</p>

				<p>When it comes to products I'm all about continuous iteration. What this means is that I create a first version of a product and get it out into the world so I can start getting feedback.</p>

				<p>This feedback dictates the improvements that I need for the next version of the product. The faster I can get out the improved version, the better things look for me.</p>

				<p>It didn't take long for me to get my Pinterest book out and in the first month I made $1,603.39.</p>

				<p>Beautiful.</p>

				<h2>Building Assets</h2>

				<p>Another important factor of writing a book was that it gave me an asset. I think when people imagine having a business they think of one course or one book that is going to handle all of the revenue generation, but it's all eggs in one basket.</p>

				<p>With multiple products you can target different sections of your audience. I don't think product creation should ever stop after one product.</p>

				<p>You have to keep the train going and that's what I started to do.</p>

				<p>Next I created a course on <a href="/course/affiliate-marketing">affiliate marketing</a>. Then I turned the <a href="/course/pinterest">Pinterest book into a course</a>.</p>

				<p>I was beginning to make money every single day with these products.</p>

				<p>It was time to turn my attention to the health & fitness niche where <a href="https://thrivestrive.com" target="_blank">Thrive/Strive</a> was building a tribe.</p>

				<p>I wasn't going to do a course or book. This time, <a href="/membership-site">I wanted to do a membership site</a>.</p>
