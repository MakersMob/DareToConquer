				<p>Creating a product is one thing. You can do a cool landing page and use the right words to get some people to buy.</p>
				<p>To get people to commit to a membership site requires a whole new mindset. These people have to want to be in your Tribe and that's the point a lot of people miss.</p>
				<p>I don't want to get into the nitty gritty but it all starts with your Why and Your Promise. To learn more about these check out my free <a href="https://daretoconquer.com/headstart">60-Day Headstart</a>.</p>
				<p>This stuff is the future of business or should I say how successful businesses truly grow.</p>
				<p>I know it's easy to get caught up in the tricks and hacks of growing a business but those things are simply tactics.</p>
				<p>If you want your brand to be strong and last you until you decide to let it go, then you need a foundation that pulls people in.</p>
				<p>That foundation isn't built upon features. It's built upon emotion.</p>

				<p>On a membership site people can get excited about the cool things you have in it, but they have to believe in what you are trying to do. Figuring this stuff out doesn't slow you down or prevent you from making the money you want.</p>
				<p>In fact, once you nail this stuff down it speeds up your growth because you know the exact message you want to relay to the world and the person you want to reach.</p>
				<h2>Streams Upon Streams</h2>
				<p>You'll notice that so far I've talked about books, courses, and membership sites as ways that I make money.</p>
				<p>The thing is, every person that enters your world will be attracted to do different things. Some people don't want to be involved with a membership site. They just want a book.</p>
				<p>Others might feel that a course will provide more insight.</p>
				<p><strong>When working on an online business there is no reason to limit yourself to one or two revenue streams.</strong></p>
