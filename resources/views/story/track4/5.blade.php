				<p>The other day I went to Target to pick up some power strips.</p>

				<p>Do you have a favorite brand of power strip? I don't. I look at what's available and usually grab the lowest price one that looks trustworthy.</p>

				<p>I never think about a specific brand of powerstrips to get because I've never had one fail on me.</p>

				<p>However, if one did then I would certainly remember that brand.</p>

				<p>When we deal with a brand the only thing that we expect is for them to fulfill the promise that they gave us.</p>

				<p>That's it.</p>

				<p>If they don't do that then when we remember.</p>

				<p>If they do that then we might keep them in mind for the next time.</p>

				<p>If they go beyond that Promise then we tend to always go back to them.</p>

				<p>Do you know what the biggest comparison people make between DTC and other places? The ability to ask questions and get answers.</p>

				<p>It's never about the content. People enjoy the courses and journeys and guides, but it's the ability to ask me and others questions and get the help in realtime.</p>

				<p>At the end of the day if everyone continues to improve their SEO Courses then we are all going to have the same SEO Course. So what is going to make me different from others?</p>

				<p>What is going to make people rave about DTC to their friends?</p>

				<p>It's me following through on my Promise and then going beyond it.</p>

				<p>That's all great businesses do.</p>

				<p>You make a Promise and then you fulfill it.</p>

				<p>If you can't then you either need to adjust the Promise or face the consequences.</p>

				<p>Don't tell me you've created a car that will last me a decade when it breaks down in 24 months.</p>

				<p>Don't tell me you're going to provide me with a great flight experience and then make me pay $235 for bringing a ziploc bag of chips on the plane.</p>

				<p>What is your product going to do for me? What is your book going to teach me? What is your course going to help me do?</p>

				<p>This is an awesome win but this is the kind of stuff that I promise that I will help people with. If someone asks Dela about DTC she will (hopefully) say that DTC helped her do what I said it would help her do.</p>

				<p>My promise isn't to create miracles. My Promise is simply to provide you with the tools that will aid you in creating the lifestyle that you want.</p>

				<p>Whether you use those tools is up to you but I don't want anyone saying "I just didn't find what I needed in DTC".</p>

				<p>I can't have that because then that means I failed in my Promise.</p>

				<p>The Upside Down Sale Funnel begins with a simple action and that action is making a Promise.</p>

				<p>Next you just need to fulfill that Promise to a single person. You don't need to reach the masses. You just start with a single person.</p>

				<p>When you know you're capable of fulfilling that promise to a single person then you look for another.</p>

				<p>Everyone is out there trying target 1000s of people through ads and here I am just looking for the next person to add to my Tribe.</p>

				<p>Now I have 1,300 Tribe Members (and growing) who, if I fulfill my Promise, will do all of my marketing for me. Not because I asked them to, but because they want to.</p>
