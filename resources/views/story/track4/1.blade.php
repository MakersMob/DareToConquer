				<p>There is a subset of online business owners that make MILLIONS of dollars a year.</p>

				<p>I'm not talking about the scam artists or those riding trends.</p>

				<p>I'm talking about those that consistently put out things that help them make over $100,000 a month.</p>

				<p>Now, you might be thinking you don't need to make that much and I hear ya. That's a lot of money which sounds like a lot of work.</p>

				<p>But here is the thing, it isn't that much more work than what most people already do with an online business. In fact, with the right things in place it might be even less work!</p>

				<p>How is that possible?</p>

				<p><strong>Funnels.</strong></p>

				<p>Funnels?</p>

				<p>Yep.</p>

				<p>Funnels are basically a series of steps that walk a person through a journey where hopefully the journey ends in a sale.</p>

				<p>You've been in 100s of sales funnels in your lifetime. The good ones don't even appear to be sales funnels while the terrible ones feel cheap and slimy.</p>

				<p>Nobody wants to feel cheap and slimy.</p>

				<p>In fact, I don't even like the term funnel because it makes it seem like you are herding animals to the slaughterhouse.</p>

				<p>I've done funnels with great results but I never liked the actual execution of them.</p>

				<p>Landing page > webinar that is going to expire even though it's up all of the time > sales page with expiring offer which has no reason to expire > upsell which catches a person by surprise > another upsell.</p>

				<p>Don't get me wrong. I understand why people do these things. They work!</p>

				<p>In fact, they work so well that really there is no reason to abandon them.</p>

				<p>I guess I don't like them because they come across as faking the funk and using tricks to get someone to make a purchase.</p>

				<ul>
				<li>If a webinar doesn't really expire why do I have to trick a person into thinking they better get in on it now?</li>
				<li>If a sales offer doesn't have a reason to expire besides causing panic, why do I have to trick a person into thinking it does?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Some people feel that it is necessary to use these tactics because you have to use a sense of urgency to get people to take action but I'm a bit of a pain in the ass.</p>

				<p>I always like to think that there is a better approach. An approach that will make my brand stronger and help me feel good about what I'm doing.</p>

				<p>I'm okay with how things are done here at Dare to Conquer and I'm only okay with it because of the most powerful marketing technique known to man.</p>
