				<p>One of the most difficult tasks in marketing is being able to target the right person. People who get started with an online business tend to think that any traffic is good traffic. Any subscriber is a good subscribers.</p>

				<p>If I have a list of 15,000 people and only 500 end up purchasing my products, are the other 14,500 people good people to target in the future?</p>

				<p>Some of them maybe, but most of them probably not.</p>

				<p>Traditional funnels tend to target a large group of people and then move them along a funnel. Most fall out before they reach the end of the funnel but the ones that do reach the end equal a large amount of money.</p>

				<p>The reverse funnel is the complete opposite and much more difficult to pull off.</p>

				<p>Before I go into it I want to tell you about Hilda.</p>

				<p>When I first met Hilda she had signed up for DTC and basically told me that she needed to make this work within 6 months.</p>

				<p>She needed to know from me that she could make $1,000 a month from her site in 6 months.</p>

				<p>I was honest with her and told her that it is very possible but it doesn't mean she will do it. She would have to make sure she does some things to make it happen and if she followed through on those things, it would happen.</p>

				<p>Now, something that you need to know about Hilda is that she questions everything and is a perfectionist is the bad sense of the word.</p>

				<p>I say bad sense because sometimes perfectionism can prevent you from getting anything done.</p>

				<p>Oh, she also wanted to use a free theme for her site so that no money was being spent.</p>

				<p>Basically, this was going to be an uphill climb but I believe that everyone deserves a shot at achieving the lifestyle that they want so we were going to make this happen.</p>

				<p>I broke down the steps that she needed to follow and basically let her go. I knew if she followed what was necessary she would see some progress.</p>

				<p>And she did.</p>

				<p>After 4 months she got into Mediavine with a default WordPress theme and only money spent on a Pinterest scheduler.</p>

				<p>A few months ago she sent me this:</p>

				</div>

				<p>If someone asks her about DTC what do you think she is going to say?</p>

				<p>Her words will be more powerful than mine because the people she talks to can relate to her better they can me. Her word is stronger than mine which is something I can live with.</p>

				<p>So what does this have to do with the upside down funnel?</p>

				<p>Everything actually.</p>

				<p>For it to make sense though, we need to full explore what a traditional online sales funnel looks like and <a href="/broken-funnels">why I think it's a broken way to do business</a>.</p>
