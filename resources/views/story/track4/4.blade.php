				<p>There are millions upon millions of people that don't know the tricks of online marketing. I'm not talking about the people that are trying to learn them. I'm talking about the people that buy things because of these tricks.</p>

				<p>This is why a lot of things that I'm going to talk about will never go out of style.</p>

				<p><em>If it ain't broke, why fix it?</em></p>

				<p>Before I jump into how these things work let me say that I don't disapprove of the methods themselves. I'm fine with them. I just don't like doing them usually. Almost any marketing method is fine in my book. It's more about the people and the things they say that can make them dicey.</p>

				<h2>A Traditional Online Sales Funnel</h2>

				<p>If you follow enough bloggers then you'll be very familiar with this stuff. At the very least you'll say "damn, I went through that exact thing!"</p>

				<p>The big time money makers usually have a funnel that goes like this:</p>

				<p><em>Facebook Ads -> Webinar Signup -> Webinar -> Special Offer -> Upsell</em></p>

				<p>Facebook Ads allow them to target certain people. The webinar allows them to share some value. The special offer builds a sense of urgency like the person has to get on this now. The upsell catches them when they have their wallet out and are in a buying mood.</p>

				<p>There are also a ton of emails that get sent to a person depending on the different actions they take or don't take. If they don't show up for the webinar then they get an email about a webinar replay that will be available for the next 72 hours only.</p>

				<p>If they don't make a purchase right away then they might get pushed into a different funnel for a lower cost product.</p>

				<p>These are brilliant tactics and it's amazing that we have technology that makes this all possible.</p>

				<p>The BIG problem with this traditional style is that if people in your audience understand it, it doesn't work on them.</p>

				<p>But like said at the beginning, there are millions of people that don't know these techniques.</p>

				<p>They really do believe that they are signing up for a specific apointment time to join a free webinar. They really do believe that the offer is expiring at midnight.</p>

				<p>I tend to not do these techniques because they feel fake. I like to think that there is a better way that feels more authentic and that's my problem.</p>

				<p>As more and more brands start to vie for a person's attention, what kind of brand starts to stand out? Is it the brand that does things the way others do or is it the brand that takes the time to build a relationship?</p>

				<p>When I think about the brands that I love I don't see free webinars, expiring offers or other gimmicks. Sure you can tell me that this is the online world and this is different, but why?</p>

				<p>If you could have a Hilda love everything that you do so much that she tells her audience about it, then why wouldn't you aim for that instead?</p>

				<p>Can you get that with a Facebook Ad and Webinar? Maybe. It wouldn't work on me, but I'm the only me so who knows.</p>

				<p>I had to figure out what it took to get someone like Hilda to fall in love with my brand and become a brand ambassador.</p>
