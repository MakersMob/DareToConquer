				<p>Maybe you're thinking that at this point I'm already an entrepreneur and that's where people mess up. They get caught up in the idea of being an entrepreneur without thinking about what it means.</p>

				<p>To find out if you're an entrepreneur ask yourself two simple questions:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Does your business make money?</li>
					<li>Does your business need you around to make money?</li>
				</ol>

				<p>To be considered an entrepreneur you should answer <em>Yes</em> to the first question and <em>No</em> to the second.</p>

				<p>Is a business really a business if it isn't making money? Is an entrepreneur someone that creates things that don't make money?</p>

				<p>If you always have to be around for your business to function or to make money then you're a freelancer, not an entrepreneur. Freelancers do what people at a 9-5 job do and that is exchange time for money.</p>

				<p>They just play by different rules.</p>

				<p><em>Dammit, I keep veering off course. Back to the New York Cat.</em></p>

				<p>All I had done at this point was write blog posts making myself sound smarter than I am.</p> 

				<p>I had a random dude that I didn't know ask me what my rates were and I would only become an entrepreneur if I got paid.</p>

				<p>Well, I got paid.</p>

				<p><strong>I was a freelancer who thought he was an entrenpreneur.</strong></p>

				<p>That didn't matter because I was making money.</p>

				<p>I had my own business that didn't have a name, bank account or dedicated website.</p>

				<p>I didn't know how much I was supposed to charge. I didn't know if there were papers that needed to be signed.</p>

				<p><strong>Basically, I didn't know jack or shit.</strong></p>

				<p>But here I was designing a website for a guy that found me online through a blog that I didn't even technically own. This was awesome!</p>

				<p>Wait a second. Let's rewind the tape.</p>

				<p><em>...through a blog that I didn't even technically own.</em></p>

				<p>That's right. Because this blog was on the company website, I didn't own it. In fact, my boss didn't even know about it. We will get back to that in a minute.</p>

				<p>Almost every single aspect of this new freelancing <em>business</em> was something that I controlled. I didn't have someone looking over my shoulder asking what I'm doing. I didn't need to work on something I didn't want to. I didn't need to pretend I was working even though there was nothing to do.</p>

				<p><strong>I was creating and I was getting paid for it.</strong></p>

				<p>I needed more.</p>

				<p>It was time to create my own website to advertise my own services. I also stopped blogging on the website that my boss owned because I needed that audience on my site.</p>

				<p>Again, my boss didn't know about the blog at the time but when I created my own website she found out and wasn't happy.</p>

				<p>Here is the amazing part. She found out because a friend that was learning web design found "my" blog and was reading it every day. When I announced on that blog that I was moving to another domain she told boss lady.</p>

				<p>In my boss's head, I was taking clients away from her website and trying to sell them on my services.</p>

				<p>My services had nothing to do with her services but she didn't see it like that so she told me I could shut down my site or I was fired.</p>

				<p>My options were:</p>

				<ol>
				<li>Stay at a job where I wasn't happy getting a guaranteed paycheck</li>
				<li>Work for myself and see what was really out there</li>
				</ol>

				<p><strong>#2 all day long.</strong> I didn't even need to think about it. I didn't know if I was meant to be a web designer but I knew I wasn't meant to work for someone else.</p>

				<p>Off I went to try and do my own thing.</p>

				<p>My Mom wasn't pleased but that's because she didn't understand. This was all new to most people out there.</p>

				<p>I didn't know if it was going to work out but I had to see. Going to another job and not knowing if I could've made a life that I truly loved would've bugged me forever.</p>

				<div class="recap">
					<h3>Are you meant to do more?</h3>
					<p>I think there is a powerful human string that gets pulled from time-to-time. When this string gets pulled it triggers something.</p>

					<p>That something asks you a simple question:</p>

					<p><em>Are you meant to do more?</em></p>

					<p>It's a simple, yet powerful question and one that always gets me. Even after all that I've done that string gets pulled.</p>

					<p>The only way to find out is by going out and seeing if you are meant to do more.</p>

					<p>Well I tried to do more.</p>
