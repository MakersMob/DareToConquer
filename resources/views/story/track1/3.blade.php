				<p>Look, it's not that I failed as an entrepreneur. I sold my company for $75,000 but it was mostly luck.</p>

				<p>I say that because I never did anything that any sensible business person would've done. I just coasted on the things that were fun for me to do.</p>

				<p>I wasn't consistent with anything. I didn't have a revenue model that was consistent. I didn't really do marketing besides randomly writing blog posts hoping that people would love them and leave comments.</p>

				<p>There was no method to the madness of my business. When I had the chance to sell the company I did and I took some time off.</p>

				<p>Not to reflect or figure out my next move, but to party and enjoy life. Basically what I was already doing when I had a company.</p>

				<h2>Freedom</h2>

				<p>When I look back at this period of my life it's easy to say that I wasted it but I don't think that is the case.</p>

				<p>What it taught me is that freedom is a powerful thing. I didn't realize it yet because it always seemed to be available to me. I could do what I wanted when I wanted.</p>

				<p>I actually had a <em>life</em>.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, we live in a world that requires money if you still want to life this type of freedom.</p>

				<h2>Another Job</h2>

				<p>When I started dating this wonderful woman, who is now my wife, she told me that she wanted to be with someone that could earn money in a consistent way. I wasn't doing that and even after 6 years of running my own business I still didn't know how to do that.</p>

				<p>So I got a job.</p>

				<p>Maybe it would be different than last time. Maybe I wouldn't hate the idea of working for someone else.</p>

				<p>And it was different.</p>

				<p>I liked my boss. I liked my co-workers.</p>

				<p>And it wasn't different.</p>

				<p>I hated making other people a lot of money.</p>

				<p>I hated having ideas that nobody would ever implement.</p>

				<p>I hated the idea of feeling like I was being held back.</p>

				<p>I hated the idea of clocking in for 40 hours when I could've done my job in 7.</p>

				<p>Over a span of 3 years I had 3 different jobs. Each one was great and each one made me miserable.</p>

				<p>Once you experience the freedom of working for yourself, you find it hard to ever go back. It's like being an animal that is released from captivity, running wild and then getting put back in a cage after 6 years.</p>

				<p>But a fortunate thing happened after the 3rd company I was working for laid off everybody in the West Coast office: <em>I couldn't get another job</em>.</p>

				<p>I tried. I got a ton of interviews. 17 actually but nobody would hire me.</p>

				<p>I suck at interviews. Again, I was leaving my fate in someone else's hand and it had nothing to do with my experience. It all depended on if they liked me or not and could see past my nervousness.</p>

				<p>The whole time I was doing my interview rounds I kept thinking that I should go off on my own again but I wasn't sure what magical idea I was going to pursue.</p>

				<p>I was coming up with some really good ideas.</p>

				<p><em>Note from the Reflective Mind:</em> Any idea that you come up with will seem brilliant to you.</p>

				<h2>Not Going Back</h2>

				<p>I'd spend a couple weeks working on one of my ideas and when it didn't gain traction I'd give up. 9 year earlier I sat down and started blogging and everything fell into place.</p>

				<p>I wasn't blogging anymore but I knew if I just did something then magic would happen.</p>

				<p>It doesn't work that way. What happened to me before wasn't luck. I was doing things that work for all businesses but I didn't know exactly what I was doing.</p>

				<p>For two years I did client work and I borrowed money from friends and family because I refused to get a job. I couldn't do it. My soul wouldn't recover.</p>

				<p>After two years nothing I was doing was working. I didn't know why. I'm a smart person and I was doing smart things.</p>

				<p><strong>Why was everyone else (literally everyone), but me, in the world making money online?</strong> I would look at something they did and think it was the one thing that made them famous or help them make the money they wanted.</p>

				<p>Nope. I tried that one thing and it wasn't working.</p>

				<p>What in the hell was happening?</p>

				<p>My wife was getting frustrated. She hated stressing about money. She hated not knowing if we could pay our bills.</p>

				<p>My stubborness to not get a job wasn't helping my life or my marriage.</p>

				<p>Something had to change so I did the one thing that I never thought I could do: push my ego to the side.</p>

				<p>Obviously, being successeful online doesn't require you to the smartest person in the room or have some insane skills. I was looking at income reports by people that were doing ordinary things but getting extraordinary results.</p>

				<p>If they could do it, obviously I could as well. I just had to see what they were doing.</p>

				<p>I kept on looking and looking and looking. I re-read income reports. I looked at the blog posts but nothing was standing out.</p>

				<p>Just because you had an affilaite link didn't mean people would click on it.</p>

				<p>Just because you had a product didn't mean people would buy it.</p>

				<p>What were these people doing?</p>

				<p>Then one day it finally clicked.</p>

				<p>I discovered <a href="/value-money"><em>The Big Secret</em> that wasn't really a secret</a>.</p>
