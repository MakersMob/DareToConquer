				<p>Having a service-based business isn't terrible. The problem with it is that you're still trading time for money. I had to get away from that and I knew that if I could crack the code with Thrive/Strive then I would be on to something.</p>

				<p>But after 90 days things were looking bleak until something happened at the end of August.</p>

				<p>One post caught a little bit of heat. I wouldn't call it viral but you could call it viral because viral is all relative.</p>

				<p>If the only thing you've ever seen is a penny, then that one quarter that crosses your path is a ton of money.</p>

				<p>That one post was going to change the whole trajectory of what we were doing.</p>

				<p>At least I thought.</p>

				<p>September was much better traffic wise than June - August but it wasn't what I expected. We had a post doing well why weren't the others?</p>

				<p>That's when I realized that most of the things we were writing were meant for us and not our audience.</p>

				<p>It's like walking into a restaurant and the chef brings out a grilled cheese sandwich because that's what they were craving. It isn't what you ordered but it doesn't matter to the chef.</p>

				<p>The chef wants what the chef wants.</p>

				<p>That's just bad business unless you walk into a restaurant specifically to get whatever the chef is feeling that day.</p>

				<p>You can't do that with your business. <strong>If you want to bring people to your site you have to give them what they want.</strong></p>

				<p>I made the mistake of believing that it was my Pulitzer Prize winning writing that was bringing people in so many years ago when the reality was that it was because I was providing value by teaching web design. I just also happened to use Pulitzer Price winning writing to go along with it.</p>

				<p>Once this very simple concept entered my consciousness the game completely changed.</p>

				<p>Seriously.</p>

				<p>Take a look at October.</p>

				<p>Notice that spike at the end?</p>

				<p>It wasn't a one-off miracle.</p>

				<p>Here is November.</p>

				<p>And December.</p>

				<p>Traffic is great but it means nothing if you aren't making money. Nobody is proud to say they got 200,000 pageviews but are still struggling to pay the bills.</p>

				<p>Here are some of the money numbers that come our way via Thrive/Strive and other health sites.</p>

				<p><em>Other health sites?</em></p>

				<p>Yep. I got so good at understanding the basics of online business that I had to see if I could replicate the success again and again and again.</p>

				<p>So I created more sites and saw more success. Okay, great. Maybe that's just in the health niche. Let me try another niche.</p>

				<p>I started making money in Personal Finance. Then in Home Decor. Then in Parenting.</p>

				<p>Basically, any niche that I wanted to enter, I could use the basic principles that I learned to achieve success in it.</p>

				<p><strong>This stuff is Universal and it's stuff that absolutely anybody can do.</strong> <em>Dare to Conquer</em> exists because I don't want you to go through a dozen plus years of experimentation.</p>

				<p><em>DTC</em> exists because I know that feeling of being at a job asking yourself <em>is there more for me?</em>.</p>

				<p>You should be able to decide what you want to do in life, follow some guidelines and achieve those goals that you want.</p>

				<p>Sound about right?</p>

				<p>Indeed it does. So the next question to ask is <a href="/next-steps">what happens now?</a></p>
