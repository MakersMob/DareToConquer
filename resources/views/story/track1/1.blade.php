				<p>My first online business started off as a blog. I didn't really see the blog as a business but that is exactly what it was.</p>

				<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's go back to the beginning.</p>

				<p>Growing up I always wanted to do something cool or that makes a lot of money.</p>

				<p>Preferably both.</p>

				<p>I wanted to be all of the following at some point in my life:</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Astronaut (Space Shuttle blowing up killed that one)</li>
				<li>Doctor</li>
				<li>Chemical Engineer</li>
				<li>Professional Soccer Player</li>
				<li>Zoologist</li>
				<li>Marine Biologist</li>
				<li>Astronomer</li>
				<li>Comic Book Artist</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Not once did <em>entrepreneur</em> enter the equation because I didn't know that was a possibility for someone like me. Hell, I didn't know that was a thing.</p>

				<p>I grew up lower middle-class. We didn't have much. My Mom worked room service at a hotel and my Dad worked at a dairy. I was always told that if you wanted to be something you had to go to college and get a fancy degree.</p>

				<p>However, this was before the Internet was starting to get its groove on.</p>

				<p><strong>The Internet changed everything but only for those whose eyes were open.</strong></p>

				<h2>The Nervous Nerd</h2>

				<p>I was always on the computer, even before the World Web Web became a thing because when I was 6 I asked for a Nintendo and my parents and grandparents got me a computer instead.</p>

				<p>So I did all I could on the computer.</p>

				<p>The World Wide Web (I'll just say <em>Internet</em> from now on but I'm trying to be technically accurate) was my home. I loved the fact that I could learn anything that I wanted to and that everybody was creating something.</p>

				<p>When I graduated college I got a job as a headhunter helping people find jobs. But I hated talking to people on the phone.</p>

				<p>I'd get nervous and not know what to say. It was a disaster. I told my boss I could build her a website after I caught her talking about one. That got me off of the phones.</p>

				<p>I didn't know shit about building a website but I knew the Internet could quickly teach me. I started doing research and I always came across blogs where people were teaching you how to do certain design techniques.</p>

				<p><strong>I absolutely LOVED the idea of someone learning something and then sharing their knowledge with the world so I figured I would start a blog as I learned about blogging.</strong></p>

				<p>Little did I know I had a knack for writing and sharing my opinion.</p>

				<p>One day, a bigger blogger came across my stuff, linked to me ,and then I had 1000s of people coming to my site each month.</p>

				<p>These were people I didn't know and they were from all around the world. They loved what I was doing and I loved what I was doing.</p>

				<h2>A New York Cat</h2>

				<p>One day this guy in New York emails me and says that he wants a website designed and asks what my rates were.</p>

				<p>Hold on a second. Rates? Website designed?</p>

				<p>I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD SERVICES TO OFFER!</p>

				<p>And that's when I realized the true potential of the online world and having an audience. It all started with me sharing my opinion on something that I was learning and it led to me potentially getting paid for something that I didn't even know if I could do.</p>
