				<p><strong>Business is nothing more than someone giving you money in exchange for value.</strong></p>

				<p>That's it.</p>

				<p>Everything else is based off of this simple concept and yet when I tell people this they roll their eyes.</p>

				<p>Business has to be more than this, but it isn't.</p>

				<p>Everything that the gurus talk about is ways to either convey that value or produce that value so someone pays you for it.</p>

				<p>That meant when I created my web design blog I was creating value for people and when I tried to start other business 9 years later I wasn't creating any type of value except for myself.</p>

				<p>And that's the big difference.</p>

				<p>The better you get at producing value for people, the more money you will make. You might think about some things that you purchased that weren't worth the money and so what I just said is a complete lie in your mind.</p>

				<p>Okay, I'll admit, what I said isn't totally true.</p>

				<p>For some people the truth is that the better they get at being able to convince people that they can provide them with value helps them make more money.</p>

				<p>That's a confusing sentence.</p>

				<p>Basically, there are people out there that can sell you the world and you'll believe them until you buy their product and realize it's trash.</p>

				<p>Everything that I do in <a href="/join"><em>Dare to Conquer</em></a> is focused around helping you learn how to produce value for your audience AND learn how to convey that value so you make more money.</p>

				<p>What's the point in having a couse on Content Creation (learning how to produce value) if you also don't have a course on Marketing with Pinterest (conveying that value)?</p>

				<p>Shit, I didn't finish my adventure. These tangents are going to be the death of me.</p>

				<h2>The Start of the Empire</h2>

				<p>Okay, so what happened next is that I decided to start blogging again. I finally returned to my roots.</p>

				<p>But I wasn't going to do it alone.</p>

				<p>My wife and brother like to workout so I figured starting a health and fitness blog would be a cool thing to do. That's when we created <a target="_blank" href="https://thrivestrive.com">Thrive/Strive</a>.</p>

				<p>We were very excited. Actually, I was excited because I got to blog again. My wife and brother simply had no idea what to expect but I told them it would be okay. I obviously knew what I was doing so there was nothing to worry about.</p>

				<p>To chronicle this journey I also started <a href="https://obstacle.co" target="_blank">Obstacle.co</a>.</p>

				<p>On Obstacle.co I was just going to be my opinionated self all over again and I figured I would do that with Thrive/Strive as well.</p>

				<p>This wasn't a good strategy and let me show you why:</p>

				<div class="image">
				<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/27201932/ts-pageviews.jpg">
				</div>

				<p>This is a traffic chart for the first 90 days of Thrive/Strive. I don't have a magical tale for you on how I created a blog and it went gangbusters after 17 days.</p>

				<p><strong>All I can tell you is that I started a blog in a very popular niche and I couldn't get the population of a tiny village on the smallest island off of the coast of Papa New Guinea to visit it over a span of 90 days.</strong></p>

				<p>13 pageviews a day on average. One page every 2 hours.</p>

				<p>Yikes.</p>

				<p>But something different happened over at Obstacle.co. In the 3rd month of that site's existence <a href="https://obstacle.co/income-report-august-2016/" target="_blank">I made over $7,000</a> and it's because I had a headstart.</p>

				<p>I was making money from design services and SEO services (freelancing). The site was well-designed and obviously my writing carried some authority so I was able to make money.</p>

				<p>The challenge would be making money from things that didn't involve me trading money for time.</p>

				<p><a href="/click">And I still had to crack the code with Thrive/Strive.</a></p>
