				<p>Someone reading this is currently thinking "what the hell? Pinterest?!"</p>

				<p>Yes. Pinterest.</p>

				<p><strong>What many people who don't use Pinterest fail to understand is that Pinterest is a discovery engine as much as anything else.</strong> People go on Pinterest to actively search for solutions to their problems.</p>

				<p>Yes, a lot of people go on there just to browse and see what's new but there are times when they need to find something and during those times they turn to Pinterest.</p>

				<p>If you can get your pin in front of those people then you have a chance of getting the traffic that you want.</p>

				<h2>Gimme, Gimme, Gimme</h2>

				<p>At this point maybe your eyes are lighting up and you're running over to Pinterest to get your content on there. You'll go and you'll pin and pin and pin and nothing will happen.</p>

				<p>You're putting in all of this hard work, why aren't you getting results? Shouldn't Pinterest see how hard you are working and decide to show your pins over everyone else's?</p>

				<p>Not quite.</p>

				<p>You have to go in with some type of strategy.</p>

				<p>The DTC Pinterest Workflow doesn't contain a lot of steps because nothing that you do in building a successful business should be complicated.</p>

				<p>The difficult part is making sure you nail each of the steps.</p>

				<p>A big mistake that people make is believing that the work begins on Pinterest when it really doesn't. <strong>The work begins on your site.</strong></p>

				<p>If you can't create compeling content that will interest your audience, then there is no point in trying with Pinterest. You need to understand how to write the type of content that is going to get people to sit down and take notice.</p>

				<p>It's like setting up a lemonade stand that has terrible lemonade. You need to get that lemonade recipe down first before you get it into the hands of others.</p>

				<p>Once that is done then you can tackle Pinterest.</p>

				<h2>The Two Things</h2>

				<p>Pinterest has two components:</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Search</li>
				<li>Visual</li>
				</ul>

				<p>If you can do well with one of these you'll see great results. If you can do well with both of these then you'll see awesome results.</p>

				<h3>Search</h3>

				<p>Pinterest is a search engine disguised as a visual platform. When people search they want to find the right solutions and Pinterest needs help in understanding what those solutions are.</p>

				<p>It can decipher that from a simple image so it needs to look at pin titles, descriptions and the boards the pin is being saved to.</p>

				<p>When you can target these 3 things effectively, you'll start to see results.</p>

				<h3>Visual</h3>

				<p>Some pins get noticed more than others. It's just the nature of the beast.</p>

				<p>The funny thing is, it isn't always based up on great a pin looks. Ugly pins get clicks as well so what things are needed to make a pin stand out from the rest?</p>

				<p>Understand that and you'll have a better chance of Pinterest success.</p>

				<h2>DTC Bootcamp: Pinterest</h2>

				<p>I've created a <a href="https://daretoconquer.com/bootcamp/pinterest" target="_blank">free email Pinterest Bootcamp</a> for you that goes deeper into these things. It saves me from trying to cram everything into a single page and it also allows you to learn how to conquer Pinterest while ignoring your boss at that one meeting you always hate going to.</p>

				<h2>DTC Course: Pinterest</h2>

				<p>If you really want to get comprehensive with this stuff then check out the course, <a href="/course/pinterest">DTC: Pinterest</a>.</p>

				<h2>More Eggs, More Baskets</h2>

				<p>I'm sure you've heard the saying that you shouldn't put all of your eggs into one basket. I like that saying because it applies to online business.</p>

				<p>Once you start to do well with Pinterest you can easily get fooled into ONLY focusing on Pinterest. The problem with that is what happens when Pinterest changes things up and stops giving you traffic?</p>

				<p>I know I said I found a way to avoid that and so far I have, but I don't own Pinterest. Maybe one day they decide to only show purple pins. The reality is Pinterest shouldn't be your only source of traffic.</p>

				<p>Besides, why would you want to settle for what only Pinterest can send you?</p>

				<p>Why not get more traffic from other places while keeping Pinterest traffic?</p>

				<p>That's what we needed to do with Thrive/Strive because I didn't want to see another major dip in traffic simply because Pinterest sneezed.</p>
