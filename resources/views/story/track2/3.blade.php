				<p>I'll be honest with you. I never touched Pinterest before I got back into this online business game. It was something that my wife was always on so I figured it was a place to save recipes and look for home decor ideas.</p>

				<p>When we decided to start a site on health and fitness, I signed us up for Pinterest and pinned our content to the site but that was the extent of it. I didn't pay attention to Pinterest.</p>

				<p>Once I saw that the carbs post was getting traffic from Pinterest I figured it was time for me to dive into it a bit more.</p>

				<p>Let me preface this next statement by saying I'm an idiot.</p>

				<p><strong>Pinterest should've been the first major promotion strategy that I focused on, even before the site launched.</strong></p>

				<h2>The Research</h2>

				<p>Because a lot of the sites we admire were on Pinterest I started to dive into their profiles and because Pinterest shows you how many repins (saves) a pin has, I was able to see what content their audience liked.</p>

				<p><em>Literally this is all we needed to get traffic.</em></p>

				<p>We didn't have to guess what our audience wanted to read about because we could just look at similar sites and see what was getting repinned.</p>

				<p>If people were repinning a pin about a morning yoga routine, then why shouldn't we write about a morning yoga routine?</p>

				<p>It's annoying how simple of a concept this is. People weren't seeing success online because they were smarter or better writers or had some secret strategy.</p>

				<p><strong>It was because they were writing about the things their audience wanted and then they made sure their audience knew about them.</strong></p>

				<p>That's it.</p>

				<p>If you don't nail this part then everything else that you do is useless.</p>

				<p>You can research about how to build an email list or create a sales funnel but those won't matter if you can't create the value that your audience wants.</p>

				<p>So with this in mind I started to run tests on Pinterest to understand it better and see what works. Once we understood the content we needed to write, I had to understand how to make sure our audience saw it.</p>

				<p>After a couple of months of experimentation I finally came up with a Pinterest strategy that I felt comfortable sharing with others.</p>

				<p>It worked on a number of different profiles across different niches so why wouldn't it work for people and their own sites?</p>

				<p>There was just one small, tiny, itty bitty problem.</p>

				<p>Pinterest changed things.</p>

				<p>My traffic went from monumental highs to monumental lows in just a span of weeks. It was happening to almost everybody.</p>

				<p><em>Almost.</em></p>

				<p>It's not like 10s of millions of people stopped using Pinterest so where was this traffic going? Some people had to be benefitting from it.</p>

				<p>While I was trying to figure out the new Pinterest algorithm Pinterest made another change!</p>

				</div>

				<p>This time it helped me out and all of my sites were experiencing huge traffic gains.</p>

				<p>Okay, so Pinterest makes changes to how they show pins a couple times a year. That's not good if you are using trendy methods that help you do well.</p>

				<p>There had to be a consistent way to do well on Pinterest where you no longer had to worry about if Pinterest made a change or not.</p>

				<p>I wanted to find a strategy that kept the traffic coming in and helped me keep my sanity.</p>

				<p>I finally found it and <a href="/pinterest-strategy">DTC's Pinterest Workflow</a> was born.</p>
