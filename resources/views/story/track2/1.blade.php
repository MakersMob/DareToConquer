				<p>I've never been one to lack for ideas. I come up with ideas for new businesses almost every hour it seems.</p>

				<p>I used to be way worse about it when I was younger because I didn't have a filter.</p>

				<p>If I had an idea for a business then it was a great idea for a business.</p>

				<p>I would start some of these businesses (more like side projects that I hoped became businesses) and then after a couple of weeks or months they would fizzle out and I would look for the next thing.</p>

				<p>It wasn't a good look.</p>

				<p>In fact, it was a pretty crappy cycle that caused me to waste years of my life. I wasn't learning and I wasn't making progress on anything and one of the main reasons for that was because I wasn't getting any type of traffic.</p>

				<p>I don't mean a lot of traffic. I mean <em>ANY TRAFFIC</em>.</p>

				<p><strong>It's pretty hard to stay motivated when nobody is coming to see what you've created.</strong></p>

				<p>It sucks.</p>

				<p>You think you've done something awesome and yet all you get are crickets. Actually, you don't even get crickets because with crickets at least you'd have an audience.</p>

				<p>I went through the same thing with my site <a href="https://thrivestrive.com" target="_blank">Thrive/Strive</a>.</p>

				<p>It's a site that I work on with my wife and brother and after 90 days our combined traffic was diddly and squat.</p>

				</div>

				<p>That's 1,195 pageviews in 90 days. Basically a pageview every other hour.</p>

				<p>Because I was working with other people that were relying on my knowledge of business to push us through I knew I couldn't give up but my brother was feeling discouraged.</p>

				<p>He had never been through the cycle of putting work into something that you are interested in only to find out that nobody else is interested in it.</p>

				<p>If I wasn't around to keep on encouraging him he definitely would've thrown in the towel. Thankfully, one day something happened.</p>

				<p>People came to visit and it was for a post that I never knew stood a chance of getting traffic.</p>

				<p>That's when I learned the most valuable lesson of content creation and generating traffic:</p>

				<p><em><a href="/content-traffic">Write content that people are searching for.</a></em></p>
