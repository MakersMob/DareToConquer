				<p>That is not a good balance of traffic.</p>

				<p>While I loved admiring the kind of traffic that Pinterest was sending me, I would still get annoyed that a lot of the traffic would come and stay for one page.</p>

				<p>That's how most social media traffic works. People browse on their phones and they want to return back to their network almost as soon as they left.</p>

				<p>There are certain numbers that I always look at when it comes to my sites' analytics:</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Pages per session</li>
				<li>Time on page</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The reason why I like looking at these two metrics is because it shows that people are sticking around and exploring the site more. That is never a bad thing.</p>

				<p>Since all of my traffic was coming from Pinterest I was trying a lot of different things to try and increase those numbers. While I would see small improvement with each change nothing major was happening.</p>

				<p>One day I opened up analytics and noticed that a new post that wasn't usually in the top 10 was getting traffic. Curious, I went to go see which pin was bringing in the traffic and it wasn't a pin at all.</p>

				<p>It was Google.</p>

				<p>What? How is this possible? I didn't specifically do any of those crazy SEO (search engine optimization) strategies that I used to read about.</p>

				<p>I was only doing basic things and figured that I didn't stand a chance of getting Google traffic unless I found a way to get a ton of backlinks.</p>

				<p>But that wasn't the case.</p>

				<p>Thrive/Strive was ranking in the top 10 for a pretty impressive keyword. Curious, I looked closer at the analytics to see if traffic from Google differed from Pinterest traffic and it did.</p>

				<p>People from Google were staying on the page longer.</p>

				<p>People from Google were exploring the site more.</p>

				<p>People from Google were signing up for my mailing list.</p>

				<p>Google traffic was amazing!</p>

				<p>I simply had to have more.</p>

				<p>I began to optimize the other posts and they started to get traffic from Google.</p>

				</div>

				<p>Compare this image with the one up above. I received as much traffic in 3 months as I did in 7 months by simply doing well on both Pinterest and Google.</p>

				<p>Eventually, the traffic I was getting from Google was more than the traffic I was getting from Pinterest and overall the traffic combined was helping me reach levels I thought were only reserved for sites that had big teams of people.</p>

				<h2>Does This Stuff Really Work?</h2>

				<p>Of course, I had to try these things on another site of mine.</p>

				<div class="image">

				</div>

				<p><em>Note: this site is extremely seasonal so January - February are naturally the highest months.</em></p>

				<p>Well looks like it worked for that site. Let me try another.</p>

				</div>

				<p>Oh. Okay. This stuff kind of does work.</p>

				<p>I was getting traffic for super-competitive keywords. Keywords that the big dogs were trying to rank for and I was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with them.</p>

				<p>Why wasn't everybody doing this? I asked around and the simple answer was that SEO seemed like Voodoo.</p>

				<p>You had to pull magic out of a hat to make it work but I was seeing that you didn't.</p>

				<p>So at this point you already know what I did.</p>

				<h2>DTC Bootcamp: SEO</h2>

				<p>Yep. The <a href="/bootcamp/seo">free SEO bootcamp</a> goes over SEO to make it easier to understand. It's like the pep talk before jumping out of a plane.</p>

				<h2>DTC Course: SEO</h2>

				<p>But if you really want all of the nitty gritty behind SEO then <a href="/course/seo">DTC: SEO</a> is for you.</p>

				<h2>All the Traffic</h2>

				<p>Building a business is all about building an audience of the right people. The resources I provide within DTC aren't just about increasing numbers because getting 10,000 people to your site that don't care about what you're writing isn't going to help you in the long run.</p>

				<p>You can successfully build your Tribe with free traffic. You just need to know what you're doing. Once you do that, then you can really start to look into <a href="/want-more-money">pushing your revenue to new heights</a>.</p>
