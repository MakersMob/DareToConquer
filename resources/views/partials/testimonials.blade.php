                        <p>I've bought more courses than I care to count to help take my online business to the next level.
                        Usually, I make it through the entire course in a few days and glean a few good tips or processes. After that, the course goes into a file or list somewhere and I rarely return to it.
                        Dare to Conquer is the only course that I check in with daily. <strong>It's also the only course that I have purchased that is regularly updated. I don't mean the screenshots are updated to fit the latest software. I mean it is UPDATED! And new content is always being added.</strong>
                        I've been a part of the DTC community for over a year and I am still learning, changing, evolving, and moving forward.
                        There isn't another course or membership that I have found that works the way this one does! If you only have the funds to choose one Ultimate Guide...I would highly suggest you choose this one!</p>

                        I decided to Join DTC as I wanted to be a part of a blogging community and <strong>60 days later I got my blog to reach 10,000 readers a month and I made $300 in that month.</strong> I highly reccomend DTC if you want to grow your business.

                        DTC has given me the tools and confidence to build a successful brand and business, beyond a blog. Through his lessons and frequent e-mails, Scrivs has taught me how to focus on my strengths, message, and mission. <strong>This has helped me to better connect with my clients and readers; as well as find my tribe.</strong>

                        DTC breathed new life into my entrepreneurial soul. After three years struggling in online business, I was burned out by minimal success and too many failures. <strong>A few days into the program I realized I could pivot and do something I loved and was proud of instead of wasting my life creating a soulless business.</strong> I finally have a clear path forward and the confidence to make it happen.

                        DTC changed our business for the better. We have worked hard at implementing the strategies in the seo, Pinterest and other courses and this has allowed our business to grow. I have loved the access to Scrivs and Marybeth. <strong>Not a single other course I have done gives this much access to the creator, even when they say they do.</strong> If Scrivs says something, you know he will do it.

                        <strong>Paul Scrivens and Dare to Conquer is the driving reason that my site went from 15K pageviews per month, when I joined, to over 110K page views today in just over a year.</strong> The in-depth courses, the direct support and the DTC community are beyond anything I've experienced in any other course that I've taken on blogging or online business (and I've taken quite a few!). Everything from my content to branding and from courses to Pinterest have improved because of Dare to Conquer. If you want to up your game, you NEED to join DTC.

                        I joined Billionaire Blog Club (now Dare to Conquer) as a new blogger, and didn’t know what I didn’t know. I was previously getting 1,000 views a month and after implementing the strategies taught in the Pinterest course, I had over 10,000 views the next month! <strong>Less than 1 year after joining I was getting 100,000+ views and making over $1,500/month.

                        I joined DTC almost a year ago. Since then I’ve been able to truly create a brand not just a site. <strong>I’ve pushed boundaries & been able to start helping me family financially.</strong> I wouldn’t have been able to do it without The courses (there’s so many!)literally taking me from point A to B. Along with the community that comes with it. The instant feedback & support from both the community & Scrivs is like anything I’ve every seen.

                        As a new blogger I had shiny object syndrome and literally bought every course or membership I came across. So I can tell you what’s helpful and what’s not. <strong>DTC is the cream of the crop. It has changed my perspective on my brand and helped me develop a business that actually solves problems.</strong> Scrivs is very hands on, extremely knowledgeable, and wants you to succeed. He’s single handedly helped me improve my SEO and guided me on figuring out why I’m doing this in the first place. I wish I would have discovered this first and saved myself time and money.

                        In a very noisy marketplace, Scrivs stands out. His incredible LACK of salesy schmaltz is refreshing. He isn't teaching theories or ideas; he's taking what he knows works across multiple niches and giving you those tools to use and make work in your own business. AND IT DOES. <strong>Every time he releases a new course, I see one more course I've already taken become unnecessary. DTC has allowed me to stop looking at what's around and seeing if I need one more thing, and just log in, learn the next thing, and get it done.</strong>

                        The DTC courses have been monumental in changing the way that we think about our content and delivery. <strong>The courses directly walk you through creating an authentic experience for your readers so you can guide them towards the transformation your blog and business are aiming to create.</strong> Not only are the courses easily digestible and ideas throughly explained, but there is no time-wasting fluff, helping you to implement tools and ideas quickly and efficiently.

                        DTC has been one of the best investments I've ever made; I had no idea how much I didn't know. When I started out, I had a "if you build it they will come" mentality. <strong>I had my site open for 4 months before signing up for DTC and in that time, in total I had 1,127 sessions. 12 days after buying DTC, I had 1,243 sessions in a single DAY.</strong> The content and community you get with DTC provides value far beyond its costs, plus Scrivs personality and writing style make it entertaining and easy to understand instead of like reading a textbook.
