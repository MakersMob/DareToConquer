				<h2>What&rsquo;s the biggest hurdle to becoming a successful blogger?</h2>
				
				<h3><strong>Generating traffic.</strong></h3>

				<p>Sure you can make money blogging by just getting 5,000 people to your site a month but it becomes a helluva lot easier when you can get 100,000+ people to your site.</p>

				<p>Every month, 100s of thousands of people visit my blogs. Sometimes, I'm not even surprised to see over 100 people on my site at once!</p>

				</div>

				<p>Brings a smile to my face every single time.</p>

				<p>How do I make this happen on a consistent basis?</p>

				<p>Through the world's great marketing platform, <strong>Pinterest</strong>.</p>

				<p><em>But isn't Pinterest just for people that want to learn arts and crafts?</em></p>

				<p>While those people do exist on Pinterest, it really is so much more.</p>

				<p>In fact, it's what I consider to be one of the only solution-finding platforms on the web.</p>

				<p>The other?</p>

				<p>Google.</p>

				<p>It's no surprise that for many successful bloggers their two biggest sources of traffic are Google and Pinterest.</p>

				</div>

				<p>This makes sense because instead of paying Facebook money to actually get people to see your posts, you can simply post on Pinterest for free with the same chances of being seen as everyone else.</p>

				<p>Instagram is a wonderful platform but anybody that has tried to convert their Instagram audience to blog traffic knows that it's a losing battle.</p>

				<p>This is why for every new blog I start, my sole focus is on Pinterest.</p>

				<p>Not Facebook. Not Instagram. Not Twitter. Not Google.</p>

				<p><strong>You've been grinding for months on your blog but nobody wants to visit...</strong></p>

				<h2>Pinterest Is Deeper Than the Basics</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">

				<p>What do I mean by this?</p>

				<p>It's easy for me to tell you to do the following:</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Set up a Pinterest Business account</li>
				<li>Create a great profile</li>
				<li>Create boards with super keywords</li>
				<li>Design lovely pins</li>
				<li>Use a pin scheduler to automate things</li>
				</ul>

				<p>If that's really all it took then you wouldn't need any book or course on Pinterest. But those things are just the minimum you need to do to even have a chance of success with Pinterest.</p>

				<p>The fact of the matter is that more and more bloggers are becoming aware of the power of Pinterest. That means there is more competition getting your pins seen by your audience.</p>

				<p><strong>Have you ever wondered why some bloggers in your niche have more success with Pinterest than you?</strong></p>
				<p>What makes their pins so special?</p>

				<p>Is automated pinning really the way to go or is manual pinning the new standard?</p>

				<p>You'll learn the answers to these questions in <em>Billionaire Pinterest</em>.</p>

				<h2>Pinterest Is In Constant Motion</h2>

				<p>When I created the first version of <em>Billionaire Pinterest</em> I had Pinterest figured out.</p>

				<p>I knew exactly what I needed to do to create a successful Pinterest profile and generate 100s of thousands of pageviews every single month.</p>

				<p>But then Pinterest changed their algorithm.</p>
				<p>They can be quite sneaky sometimes.</p>

				<p>You see, Pinterest, like other social platforms, is always looking for ways to improve the experience for its users.</p>

				<p>That means it changes its algorithm in the hopes of showing the best and most relevant pins to its users.</p>

				<p>Well, if you ask any blogger that uses Pinterest, they'll tell you that these changes had a great effect on their traffic.</p>

				<p>Some of my blogs' traffic went down over 50%!</p>
				<p>I'm not afraid to admit it. It happened to almost everybody but very few people want to talk about it.</p>

				<div class="image">
					<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/27145630/traffic-analytics.png" alt="traffic drop" data-pin-nopin="true">
				</div>

				<p>Here are the pageview numbers for most of 2017:</p>
				<ul">
					<li>January: 227,512</li>
					<li>February: 239,576 (New algorithm kicks in at the end of this month)</li>
					<li>March: 139,259</li>
					<li>April: 113,153 (ouch)</li>
					<li>May: 70,058 (I'm now crying)</li>
					<li>June: 188,685</li>
					<li>July: 329,981</li>
					<li>August: 258,292</li>
					<li>September: 233,906</li>
					<li>October: 263,860</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Looking at the numbers you can see that I had to go back to the drawing board and figure out what exactly Pinterest was looking for in a pin.</p>

				<p>I had to ask myself a couple of questions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Why were some of my pins still shining while others simply disappeared?</li>
					<li>Could a pin start to receive traffic the instant it is pinned?</li>
					<li>Is there a way to beat the home feed algorithm?</li>
					<li>Are group boards created equal?</li>
					<li>Is it possible to push a pin viral if you can see the right signals?</li>
					<li>Is there a difference in performance between scheduled pinning and manual pinning?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>With Pinterest, if you aren't moving with it, it will move along without you.</p>

				<p>It's constantly in motion and that's why <em>Billionaire Pinterest</em> never stays still.</p>

				<p>In fact, this is the 3rd version of this course in the past 9 months!</p>

				<p><strong>Why would you want a course that pretends that using last year's methods will still help you this year?</strong></p>

				<h2>Take a Second and Imagine This World...</h2>

				<p>You've written an epic blog post.</p>
				<p>You are seriously proud of this bad boy and can't wait to share it with the world.</p>
				<p>In fact, it's so good that I wish that I had written it.</p>

				<p>You create a pin that is just as epic.</p>

				<p>You're excited because you know when you pin this pin, the seeds of growth will be put into motion.</p>
				<p>You're going to get the traffic that you deserve which is going to lead to the email subscribers that you deserve which is going to lead to the revenue that you deserve.</p>
				<p>You post the pin on Pinterst and anxiously wait to see what happens.
				<p>The next day you see 100s of people visiting the post. A couple days later it's now 1000s of people visiting the post.</p>

				<p>This chart is the actual result from one of my pins. I could show you charts like this over and over and over again.</p>
				<p>Will you see the exact same results of getting a post to over 10,000 pageviews in 5 days?</p>
				<p>Of course not.</p>
				<p>Sometimes it takes a tiny bit longer. See for yourself.</p>
