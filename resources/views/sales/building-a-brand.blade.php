        <p>You're going to cuss me out for saying this but the hardest thing about building a successful online business isn't making money.</p>
        <p><strong>It's building a brand that people are attached to, that they truly love, and that they can't wait to get more from.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Once you can do that, making money is easy.</strong></p>
        <p>In today's world, it's not enough just to provide value or write good content. Everyone is doing that.</p>
        <p>You have to find a way to connect with your audience and make them feel like they are the Heroes of your Brand.</p>
        <p>How do you do that?</p>
        <p>With <em>Hero Branding</em>.</p>
        <h2>The Hero and the Guide</h2>
        <p>If you can find the right story where your audience is the Hero and you are their Guide, then they will follow you to the ends of the Earth.</p>
        <p>Send out a new email? They will read it.</p>
        <p>Create a new product? They will buy it.</p>
        <p>But it requires that you understand how to follow a process that will allow you to unlock your brand's true potential.</p>
        <p>That's what you'll learn how to do in <em>Hero Branding</em>.</p>

        <p>Most people just want to know how to get a website up and bring in traffic. The problem with this type of thinking is that when you learn how to bring people to your site, you end up scrambling every single day to continue to bring more and more people to your site.</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>People don't come back because they don't feel compelled to.</p>
        <p><strong>Building a strong brand means understanding your audience and what they want.</strong></p>
        <p>It means delivering the right message so they continue to come back and more important become part of your Tribe.</p>
        <p>Building a strong brand means you get to dictate how you want your business to grow on your terms.</p>
        <p>Otherwise you're going to be chasing traffic and hoping that one day you can make enough money with ads to finally pay for that second year of web hosting.</p>
        <p>You don't look like you want to be that person.</p>
        <h3>This course is for...</h3>
        <p>The person that is thinking that they are going to build a long-term business. The type of business that lasts as long as they do.</p>
        <p>The type of business that people actually admire because they love what they do, how they do it, and more importantly WHY they do it.</p>
        <p>Quick tips, tricks and hacks only last so long and take you so far.</p>
        <p><strong>A strong brand provides you with the freedom that you're wanting to achieve in the near future.</strong></p>
        <p>If you want to avoid any long periods of time where you just don't know what to do or who you are really talking to, then this course is for you.</p>
        <p><strong>If you just want to build a simple blog where you have to spend everyday stressing about traffic and always trying to figure out your purpose, then this course is not for you.</strong></p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
        <p><strong>Do I really need a strong brand to make money?</strong></p>
        <p>Most definitely not. I've created numerous online businesses that make 4-5 figures a month without a strong brand.</p>
        <p>However, the problem is that they continuously have to find new people. New traffic. New subscribers. New customers.</p>
        <p>It's draining.</p>
        <p>Building a strong brand means you get to focus on the people that you truly want to help and that is more fulfilling, less stressful and with regards to money, more lucrative.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>How is the course delivered and when do I gain access?</strong></p>
        <p>You gain access to the course immediately.</p>
        <p>It won't be dripped out to you so you have to sit on your hands doing nothing.</p>
        <p>All DTC courses are mostly text-based with videos inserted when appropriate. This way you can consume the lessons at your own pace and easily follow along.</p>
        <p>Course are accompanied by Objectives and Exercises so that you understand what you're getting into and can be certain you understand the material.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
        <p><strong>So you'll teach me how to design my site?</strong></p>
        <p>No. When I talk about branding I talk about the emotions and thoughts that someone has when they think about you and your brand.</p>
        <p>While your logo, colors, and fonts can help strengthen those feelings, they are not where the feelings start.</p>
        <p><em>Hero Branding</em> is about diving deeper into the true essence of your business.</p>
        <p>It sounds deep and you'll definitely do a lot of introspection but you'll come out at the other side with a stronger understanding of where you want your business to go.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Is this just theory?</strong></p>
        <p>Nope.</p>
        <p>I use my own businesses as case studies and walk you through everything that you learn in the course by showing you how I do it with my own brands.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, sorry.</p>
        <p>My name is Paul Scrivens and I like to consider myself an <em>Accidental Entrepreneur</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>I have a bad habit of starting online businesses just to see where I can take them.</strong></p>
        <p>I run a couple of 5-figure a month businesses and want to help everyone that is willing to listen obstain the lifestyle that they truly want.</p>
        <p>Ever since I started and sold my first business in the early 2000s, I've been fascinated with branding and it's impact on a company's success.</p>
        <p><strong>It always feels more fulfilling when you can start something that has an impact on the people that it reaches.</strong></p>
        <p>That's why I created <em>Hero Branding</em> because I know you want to do more than just make money and start a business.</p>
        <p>You want to help improve lives and leave the world a better place than you found it.</p>
